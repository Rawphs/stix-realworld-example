/**
 * This file dictates in what order your application should be loaded.
 * Modules are loaded in the order you define them here.
 * This matters because this allows you to define which module's configuration gets merged in first and last.
 *
 * As you can see, the defaults include Gates and Application.
 *
 *  - Gates:
 *    stix-gates module allowing you to run requests through your own functions.
 *    This way you can validate and enrich requests before they end up in your actions.
 *
 *  - Application:
 *    This is your own code. This module is the default for the skeleton application.
 *    A module is just a directory with an entry file, so feel free to add/rename/remove them.
 *
